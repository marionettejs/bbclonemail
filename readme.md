BBCloneMail: A Backbone.Marionette Reference Application

## See It In Action

This is a sample application, demonstrating how to use my 
[Backbone.Marionette](http://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette)
plugin for Backbone.js. You can see it in action at:

http://bbclonemail.heroku.com

## Annotated Source Code

The annotated source code (still in progress) is available here:

http://derickbailey.github.com/bbclonemail/docs/bbclonemail.html

## A Work In Progress

Keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. While the source code
and functionality do demonstrate all of the core features and capabilities
of Backbone.Marionette, the application itself is very limited in it's 
functionality. 

Also note that I haven't optimized the JavaScript downloads in any way. There
is no minification, and no asset packaging to create a single download for the
entire application at this point. As a result, the app takes a moment or two
to download all of the JavaScript files and start up.

As I continue working on functionality, I'll also put in some optimizations for
the JavaScript, so that it starts up faster.
